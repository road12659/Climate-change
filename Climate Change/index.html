      <div class="cars">
        <p>
          Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures 
          and weather patterns across the Earth. While natural factors 
          like changes in the sun's activity or volcanic eruptions can <br>
          cause some shifts, human activities have been the primary <br>
          driver of climate change since the 1800s. <br>

        <h2>Global Temperature Rise</h2>
        <p>
          The planet's average surface temperature has risen by approximately 1.1°C (about 2°F) since the late 19th century. Most of this warming has occurred in the past 40 years, with the last decade being the warmest on record. In fact, 2024 was confirmed as the warmest year on record, exceeding the pre-industrial average by about 1.55°C.

        <h2>High Levels of Greenhouse Gases</h2>
        <p>
          While Earth's climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming trend is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. Scientific evidence from natural sources like ice cores, tree rings, and ocean sediments, combined with modern equipment like satellites, confirms this accelerated warming.

        <h2>The Ocean As A Giant Heat Sink</h2>
        <p>
          The ocean plays a critical role in regulating Earth's temperature. It has absorbed over 90% of the excess heat caused by climate change, with the top 100 meters of the ocean warming significantly since 1969. This absorption of heat is a major reason why global land temperatures haven't risen even more dramatically

      <h1>Why Help Tackle Climate Change?</h1>
      <div class="cord">
        <h4 class="fut">The Future Generation Shall Face The Consequences</h4>

        <p>
           Today's youth and future generations will disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change impacts. <br>
           This includes more frequent and intense heatwaves, floods, droughts, food and water scarcity, sea-level <br>
           rise, and the spread of diseases. Understanding these threats is vital for their own well-being and future <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Youth bring unique perspectives, creativity, passion, and energy to the climate conversation. <br>
         They are less bound by traditional thinking and are adept at using digital technologies to <br>
         raise awareness, organize movements, and propose innovative solutions. Their voices are <br>
         crucial in pushing for ambitious policies and practices. <br>
