      <h1>The Clock Is Ticking. Your Action Is The Answer.</h1>
      <p>
        From the air you breathe to the food you eat, <br>
       climate change is reshaping our world. You've <br>
       got questions, and we've got the clear, actionable information you need.

      <h1>Curious About Climate Change? We've got your answers.</h1>
      <p>
        We know the climate crisis can feel overwhelming. <br>
       But ignoring it isn't an option. This page is your essential <br>
       guide to what's happening, why it matters to you, and how <br>
       young people in Ghana and across the globe are stepping up. <br>
       It's time to turn concern into powerful change. <br>

      <h1>Causes of Climate Change</h1>
      <div class="clash">
        <h3>Burning Fossil Fuels</h3>
        <p>
         This is the largest contributor. When we burn coal, oil, <br>
         and natural gas for electricity, heating, manufacturing, <br>
         and transportation (cars, trucks, planes, ships), we <br>
         release vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2​). <br>
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="clash">
        <h3>Deforestation</h3>
        <p>
         Forests act as "carbon sinks," absorbing CO2​ from <br>
         the atmosphere. When trees are cut down for <br>
         agriculture, logging, or development, the stored <br>
         carbon is released, and the Earth's capacity to <br>
         absorb future emissions is reduced. <br>

      <div class="clash">
        <h3>Industrial Process</h3>
        <p>
         Manufacturing cement, iron, steel, plastics, and <br>
         other goods requires significant energy, often <br>
         from burning fossil fuels. Some industrial <br>
         processes also release greenhouse gases directly. <br>

      <h1>Effects of Climate Change</h1>
      <div class="fect">
        <h3>Rising Global Temperatures</h3>
          <p>
           The Earth's average surface temperature <br>
           has risen significantly, leading to more <br>
           frequent and intense heatwaves. <br>

      <div class="fect">
        <h3>Droughts</h3>
          <p>
            Prolonged periods of dryness leading to <br>
           water scarcity, impacting agriculture, <br>
           livelihoods, and increasing the risk of <br>
           wildfires. Parts of Ghana are vulnerable <br>
           to drought, affecting food security. <br>

      <div class="fect">
        <h3>Heavy Rainfall and Flooding</h3>
          <p>
            Leading to displacement, property <br>
            damage, and agricultural disruption. <br>
           Ghana, for example, experiences <br>
           significant flooding, particularly in <br>
           urban areas and coastal regions. <br>

        <h3>Transition to Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>
          Shifting away from fossil fuels to <br>
         clean energy sources like solar, <br>
         wind, hydropower, and geothermal <br>
         energy for electricity generation, <br>
         transportation, and industrial processes. <br>

        <p>
         Reducing energy consumption in homes, <br>
         buildings, and transportation through <br>
         better insulation, energy-efficient appliances, <br>
         public transport, cycling, and walking.

         and composting to minimize waste going <br>
         to landfills and producing methane.
